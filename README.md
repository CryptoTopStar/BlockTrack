# BlockTrack
A logistics smart contract for tracking a publically altered/signed ledger on the Ethereum blockchain  

# Motivation
Modern logistics based supply chains are not very transparent and as a result lend themselves to potential tampering and subsequent data discrepencies. To solve this I decided to create an application that can facilitate an effecient and fully tamper-proof supply chain using the Ethereum blockchain. 

# Frameworks
The testing and subsequent migration of the projects smart contract was done using the Truffle NodeJS framework, including the Ganache local blockchain explorer.

# Languages Used
*Smart contract written in Solidity  
*DApp UI built using HTML, Javascript (JQuery, Web3.js), & CSS
